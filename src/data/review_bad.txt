Please don't waste your money this shaver is not worth it. I have only had this razor for a little over a year and it has all kinds of problems. The motor acts up and sometimes it will work and other times it will quit in the middle of me shaving. The other thing is the foil replacements cannot be bought in stores you have to order them online which is a huge inconvenience. The one set of cutters they sell at the local stores are not the factory blades that they put on the shaver they are worse. They pull your hair and don't shave as close. Once I found this out I ordered the new foil and cutters online and it cost me almost $50 because the only place that had them in stock was Braun.

To clean this shaver you have to take the foil and cutters of by pressing a button on the side of the shaver. Since I have used this shaver so much and had to clean it the button stopped releasing the foil and cutters, now the only way to get it off is if I pry it off with a screwdriver. This is ridiculous and I should not have to do that.

As for shaving...Not really worth the money either I get a closer shave using my fusion razor and also with less irritation compared to this.

My advice to you is don't waste your money on this shaver. I would rather spend the money on the Fusion refills then buy another one of these to break in a little over a year.
