What I love about this book is that it is not a formula for "getting rich quick," or another list of what to do to make people "visit" your site. Instead, it is an extensive description of what is really happening in the real world right now.

Semantic search is intentionally difficult to game. Of all the ideas in the book, this is the most salient for me.

Google appears to want to make certain that this is NOT a game, that search is connected to ideas that are honest, original and interconnected to those real people who have taken the time to think things through. The takeaway I get from the book is the best thing to do with your business is to make it really great!

The intention of Google in all this seems promising and optimistic: they appear to want to ensure that, ongoing, we will have a way of connecting to the best ideas NOT because someone put a million hashtags in the HTML, or because someone PAID for the privilege (Google is very clear about who has paid to be in search results), but because what we find really is what we are looking for (or, actually, BETTER than what we were looking for because semantic search can fill in the blanks and know that we do not yet know that there is something better out there).
